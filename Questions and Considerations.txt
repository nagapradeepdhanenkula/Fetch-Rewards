Questions and Considerations

How would you deploy this application in production?
Containerization: Use Docker to containerize the application.
Orchestration: Deploy using Kubernetes or a similar orchestration tool.
CI/CD: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

What other components would you want to add to make this production ready?
Monitoring and Logging: Integrate with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
Security: Implement secrets management and ensure secure connections (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS).
Scalability: Use auto-scaling for the application components and optimize database performance.

How can this application scale with a growing dataset?
Message Queue: SQS can handle a large volume of messages.
Database Scaling: Use partitioning, indexing, and potentially a managed database service like Amazon RDS.

How can PII be recovered later on?
Encryption: Store original PII securely encrypted if recovery is needed.
Key Management: Use a robust key management system to handle encryption keys.

What are the assumptions you made?
PII Masking: Assumed that masking should be one-way (irreversible) to protect user privacy.
Data Structure: Assumed the JSON data structure is consistent with the provided schema.

This approach ensures a well-structured, scalable, and secure application.
